## Documentation

This repo stays surgical: design docs live in [`nearpay-brain`](../nearpay-brain/README.md), not here.

- `nearpay-brain/lld/dashboard-and-console.md` — **low-level design (dev-ready; implement from this)**
- `nearpay-brain/lld/audits/dashboard-and-console.md` — audit findings already folded into the LLD
- `nearpay-brain/roadmap/development-plan.md` — stage and step this repo is built in
- `nearpay-brain/architecture/hld.md` — system design
- `nearpay-brain/architecture/repositories.md` — repo topology and dependency rules
- `nearpay-brain/architecture/security.md`
